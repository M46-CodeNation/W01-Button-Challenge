**Author:** Peter C. Matthews

This repository contains my submission for the [Master Coding](https://wearecodenation.com/2022/04/25/master-coding/) course at *CodeNation*.

## Brief

Create a HTML page with the following:

- A background image with at least two animations.
  
- Code Nation Logo in the centre of the page so you can hover over it.
  - Make this logo spin on hover. 
  
- 4 buttons around the logo which link to:
  - Website
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Instagram
  
- These buttons should have:
  - 4 different shapes
  - Shadows
  - A different animation on each one when hover.
  - Change of colour when clicked.
